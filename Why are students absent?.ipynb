    "    New York City Public Schools are the largest public school system in the United States. As such, large datasets about all kinds of relevant topics are compiled every year in order to facilitate the best possible education for all New York City public school students. The data is publicly available and compiled by PASSNYC, a non-profit dedicated to broadening educational opportunities for New York City students. The dataset being used for this project is from 2016 called \"2016 School Explorer\". It contains data from 1270 New York City public that serve students from Kindergarten to grade eight. Based on the structuring of New York City public schools, this means that the data does not include high schools. The data contains information on schools, their location, the background of their students, and how they perform on New York State standardized tests. All data is based on averages among each school.\n",
    "    In this project the data is being used to answer the question \"Why are students absent?\". This is a pertinent question for today's schools. Only recently, in 2016, did the US Department of Education release data for chronic absenteeism. It has not been tracked in aggregate so there is little research available to understand chronic absenteeism. Much of the current research on the topic is about its affects on students. This paper seeks instead to understand why chronic absenteeism occurs.\n",

    "    The X variables being used in this project are an economic need index, average ELA proficiency, average math proficiency, trust percentage, and strong family-community ties percentage. The economic need index is a number 0-1 with the lowest economic need being 0 and highest being 1. It is calculated using a formula using data from the percentage of students in temporary housing, eligibility for HRA, a New York City social services program, and reduced cost lunch provided to students with low income. Additionally, I am using the average ELA and Math proficiency for each school. This is measured through New York State standardized testing where anything above a score of 3 is a pass. Trust percentage is a survey-based statistic that reflects if relationships between students, families, and teachers is based on respect and trust. Similarly, strong family-community ties percentage is a rating that reflects how well the school forms partnerships with families and the community it serves. Percent of students chronically absent is the Y variable, and it measures the percent of students in every school that miss ten percent or more of school in the given year. \n",
    "\n",
    "    These variables give the most complete picture of a students background, integral for understanding chronic absenteeism. The economic need of a student could have an impact on whether or not the student comes to school as the student might have limited access to school supplies, reliable transportation, and time away from dependents. Additionally, average ELA and math test scores help to understand the academic background of the child. The trust a student and family has in their teachers could be a factor in whether or not they come to school. A lack of trust could lead to a poor sense of belonging for the student, leaading them not to attend school. Lastly, whether or not the school has strong ties with the community can affect a student's ability to come to school due to social services working with the school and ensuring relevance of teaching topics. \n",

    "This data suggests that students with greater economic need have a higher rate of chronic absenteeism. The mean of lower income chronically absent students is higher, as well as the 25%, 50%, and 75% distributions, leading to the conclusion that outliers are not skewing this data, and lower income students have higher rates of chronic absenteeism. The data shows that one fourth of schools with students that on average have lower than the average in New York City have a chronic absentee rating of thirty five percent, a surprisingly large number. This means that thirty five percent of students in those schools are absent for more than ten percent of school days per year. \n",
